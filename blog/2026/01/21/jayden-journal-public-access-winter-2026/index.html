<h1>Happy 2026!</h1>
<p>(Imagine this post came out 20 days earlier than it did)!</p>
<p>This will be my final semester at York, still uncertain about plans after graduation, If you're the hiring kind of type, hmu, I do Web Dev mostly but also DevOps and Game dev I guess.</p>
<p>My goal this season is to be nicer to myself. Kinder. More compassionate. I'm generally pretty self-critical, And I've been feeling especially un-confident these days. I want to learn how to balance discipline and consistentcy with giving myself grace and compassion, the ability to be willing to not be hard on myself for not being perfect.</p>
<p>I'm only taking 2 classes this term, so most of my time will be spent with personal work and a bit of contract stuff on the side. I've also resumed studying Kanji + Vocab with Wanikani, I've been procrastinating with grammar but I'll have to hop back on that too. Planning on FINALLY going to Japan in May (probably).</p>
<p>If you're wondering what happened to that Roguelike I spent all summer working on, well it's on hiatus (I know, cancelled video game projects, how novel). I ran into a lot of specific game design problems I didn't have good answers for, but more importantly I think the fundamental concept of the game itself was interesting, but it wasn't fun. If I reach an epiphany on how to make it really good I'll be sure to resume working on it, but for now I'm shelving it and exploring other ideas.</p>
<p>I've been getting into making programming languages. Being able to implement a Compiler + Interpreter/VM feels like great metric to judge if you're no longer a &quot;beginner&quot; programmer. I've been thinking of other similar programmer &quot;merit badges&quot; but I'm not smart enough to be able to discuss what those could be yet.</p>
<p>I've already gone through <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreter's</a> jlox language, but I used Java and found myself blindly copying the code to try to finish the implementation so I could put it on my resume 💀. I also ignored all of the challenges presented. So I plan on going over jlox again in C#, and clox for the first time in Go.</p>
<p>I also will probably make some games? If you count the my failed entry to the <a href="https://toronto.ubisoft.com/next/">Ubisoft NEXT</a> engine programming competition then I already have this year, Feburary is a good time for jams, with <a href="https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-15">a lot of</a> <a href="https://itch.io/jam/metroidvania-month-31-magical-girl-game-jam-13">very participatable</a> <a href="https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2026">ones</a> <a href="https://itch.io/jam/bigmode-game-jam-2026">taking place.</a> <a href="https://itch.io/jam/dreamdisc-25">Dreamdisc Jam</a> also caught my eye but I might have some healing to do with C++ after being subjected to the Horrors of Visual Studio.</p>
<p>Finally, two large blog posts should be coming this season, one a dissertation on thoughts about JRPGs, which I started writing after I had finished Expedition 33 and am finally editing and releasing, And the other on my experience with the Ubisoft NEXT competition this year.</p>
<p>I hope all is well with whoever is reading, Thank you once again for your time and attention.</p>
