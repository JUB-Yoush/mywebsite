<p><a href="https://youtu.be/F8mOXnWOrhw?si=UwW-cT4u14irsKdB">I tried Boxing lessons yesterday</a></p>
<h1>My Favorite things from the last 3 months (March 2024 - May 2024)</h1>
<p>Cool things I played or saw or used or checked out,</p>
<p>Any medium, any experience.</p>
<p>Not in sorted order.</p>
<p>These last few months were quite hectic so I'm likley forgetting a lot of things.</p>
<h2><a href="https://system-erasure.itch.io/void-stranger">Void Stranger</a></h2>
<p>I finished Void Stranger in April. It might be my new favorite game of all time? It's really good. Play it, trust me.</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you about how interesting and unique this game is, but the descovery of those interesting and unique things is a part of the Void Stranger Experince.</p>
<p>(I've already gifted it to 3 people)</p>
<h2><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/52701/Dungeon_Meshi">Dungeon Meshi</a></h2>
<p>The Dungeon is so Meshi dude</p>
<p>Trigger don't miss, great fantasy anime with amazing animation cuts, interesting worldbuilding, and very nice looking food.</p>
<p>Been watching it weekly and discussing new episodes as they come out is great, everything should come out weekly it's objectivley better.</p>
<h2><a href="">Git Learning Resources</a></h2>
<p>I finally started to learn git past running add commit and push
two things that helped were the ebook <a href="https://think-like-a-git.net/">Think like (a) git</a>, and the interactive lessons at <a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/">learngitbranching.js.org</a></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/41241/panel-de-pon/">Panel de Pon</a></h2>
<p>Panel de Pon is like if they added air dashing to Tetris.</p>
<p>It's not as elegant in it's design as Tetris (will any other game ever be?) but it is really fun, it's interesting how different the two games are when it comes to the effective playspace and relationship you have with the pieces of the board.</p>
<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">Steam Deck</a></h2>
<p>Finallly started using my steam deck and it's very nice. I want all my consoles to just be computers now. Nothing will be safe from Linux.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/44770129">Ultralearning: by Scott H Young</a></h2>
<p>This book came recomended by Barbra Oakley, James Clear, and Cal Newport. If you're into productivity and learning how to learn liturature then You've likley heard of them as the authors behind A mind for numbers: a book I've already written about, Atomic Habits: the most popular productivity book ever I think, and Deep Work, a book which has had profound effects on how I work and live my life.</p>
<p>so I was expecting this guy to be the MF &quot;Your favorite Rapper's favorite Rapper&quot; DOOM of productivity authors.</p>
<p>And was he?</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>The book is good, and I liked it, (which is why it's here). But it didn't meet the high expectations for it I gave it to begin with.</p>
<p>I have smoked a whole lot of productivity books, and this one isn't too different from what I've read. The major difference between this and others (and why it's so recomended) is it's incredibly actionable (Unlike Cal Newports new book LOL).</p>
<p>He gives a very specific outline on how to learn diffifcult things quickly and effectivley, with steps and prodecures it's important to apply to your learning process.</p>
<p>If you're looking to learn how to learn things well, check this one out.</p>
<h2><a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide/">Hacking your 3ds</a></h2>
<p>Nintendo took down the e-shop and online servers so you're now excempt from any ethical quams!</p>
<p>That and hacking your 3ds is a lot easier then it used to be (surprisingly easy, even). You used to need a special flashcard from China and a magnet, now you just need a computer an 15 minutes.</p>
<p>There's cool things to do on your 3ds, I recently discovered the <a href="https://www.korg.com/us/products/synthesizers/korg_m01d/">Korg-MOD1</a> and <a href="https://www.korg.com/us/products/synthesizers/korg_dsn12/index.php">KORG DSN-12</a>, an DAW and analog synth on your 3ds. Not homebrew applications, but without homebrew you wouldn't be able to use them anymore.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.swissgear.ca/en/swissgear-0961-wheeled-15-inch-laptop-backpack-black">Swissgear hybrid carry-on/backpack</a></h2>
<p>It's a backpack that can transform into a rolling suitcase. Traveling with it is nice.</p>
<h2><a href="http://sakawacoffee.com/">Sakawa Coffee</a></h2>
<p>Small Japanese Cafe on Danforth, the food is great and you get a lot of it for the price.</p>
<p>The GDYU execs had a &quot;Last Supper&quot; for me and all the retiring execs here and it's a great spot, I'll definetly be back .</p>
<p>Get yourself of their fresh onigiri and a 16 oz japanese drip coffee. Tell 'em Jayden sent you (they don't know who I am).</p>
<h2><a href="https://bunpro.jp">Bunpro</a></h2>
<p>It's like Wanikani but for Japanese grammar. Generally harder because there's much more nuance to grammar then there is vocuabulary, but it's been quite useful in helping me pick up things quick. You can also use it as an aid to textbooks like Genki, so it'll add an SRS to concepts that you learn in the book.</p>
<p>Next one of these will be filled with all sorts of Google and Bay Area related things.</p>
<p>If you have any recomendations of things to do, let me know!!</p>
