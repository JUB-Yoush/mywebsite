I didn't want to be beholden to an algorithm determining if people got my messages, or put my eggs in the basket of some platform that may not be around in a few years.</p><p>Email is utilitarian and boring, and the most boring and practical technology seem to stick around the longest. If I want to grow a stable and consistent group of people who are interested in being interested in the same things I'm interested in, an email list seems like the sensible option.</p><h3>What will I send, how often will I send it?</h3><p>The mailing list will primarily be a way to notify people when new blog post or other interesting things I make release. I could also potentially do a Tom Scott style "here are cool things I checked out and recommend" as well.</p><p>I'll probably send one out perhaps every 2 months? I wouldn't want to make it too often and annoy people. If there's something special I'd like to share/announce then I might include an extra one outside that schedule.</p><p>I would've also wanted to have different tiers of subscribers, from "Send me an annual update" to "Send me anything whenever man I don't even care like-" but that'll have to wait until if/when I decide to upgrade buttondown tiers.</p><h3>What if I end up doing x and breaking your trust?</h3><p>I solemnly vow to never:</p><ul><li>Sign someone up without their consent.</li><li>Post the output of an LLM</li><li>Sell your email or other information.</li><li>Do anything to make the experience of the mail subscriber worse for personal gain.</li></ul><p>I hope you can trust me!</p><footer class="footer-links"><span>+-------------+</span><div><a class="" href="/contact">contact</a> <a class="" href="https://github.com/JUB-Yoush" target="_blank">github</a> <a class="" href="https://yoush.itch.io/" target="_blank">itch.io</a> <a class="" href="/">rss (TODO)</a></div><div></div></footer></div></main><script src="../js/theme.js"></script></html>
